s_sdram
=====================
This project illustrates the use of the SDRAM on the LPC1788
OEM Board.


The project makes use of code from the following library projects:
- Lib_CMSISv1p30_LPC177x_8x : for CMSIS 1.30 files relevant to LPC178x
- Lib_MCU        	 : for LPC178x peripheral driver files
- Lib_OemBoard           : for OEM Board peripheral driver files


These library projects must exist in the same workspace in order
for the project to successfully build.
